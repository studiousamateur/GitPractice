# GitPractice
To Practice Github.
===================

This is a self tutorial to try and use github and gitbash.

This is the second edit.

When ever you edit even a single file, you need to add all the files in 'git add'. The best thing to do is 'git add .'.
This is a strange requirement.

    >>> Found a way to over come this.

    >>> first do a git add <file name with extension>
    
    >>> then do git add -a
    
    >>> this opens document with '#' commands which lists down the modified files just like the output from 'git status'.
    
    >>> go to insert mode and and add message/comment and do ':x' to save and close
    
    >>> now do a 'git push'. This pushes only the file that is required to.
